Symbol Table (ST) implementation using Hash Table:

    For the constants and identifiers we will use two different ST, as specified in the assignment.
    We will have the same hash function (sum of ascii codes % the size of the hash table), because constants can be
    strings too. In this case, it is easier to build two separate hash tables, based on the same idea.
    For each key in the hash table, we will have a unique value, which will act as an identifier for the given
    constant/identifier.

    create_entries(self) - we will create the hash table with m - "None" values for the initialization part, where m
    is the size of the hash table.

    hash_function(self, key) - the key will represent in our case an identifier or a constant; for this key, we will compute
    the sum of the ascii codes (both for strings/integers) and for it, we will have the sum modulo m as the returned result;

    add_key(self, key) - firstly, we need to check if the given key as parameter is already in the ST;
    if present, we don't have to add it again; otherwise, we need to compute where to place it in the hash table;
    for adding, we use a tuple in which we will find the given key with a unique value associated to it.

    search_key(self, key) - this function returns a boolean by computing the hash function for the given parameter; after, it checks if the
    current result is None (which means that the key has not been added yet in the hash table) or not (the key is already in the hash table);

    get_hashtable(self) - it returns the hash table itself

    populate_token_list(self) - based on the "token.txt", we will extract in a list, characters and keywords that must not be taken into account
    as constant/identifier

    count_tokens(self) - this function returns the number of tokens from "token.txt"

    check_if_const_integer(self, elem) - this function checks if the current elem is associated as an integer or as string to an identifier

    print_hash_tables(self) - this function lists the hash tables for the constants/identifiers of the current file (problem)
